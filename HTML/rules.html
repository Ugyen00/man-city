                                    <h3>Links from this site</h3>
                                <p>This website contains links to other internet sites on the World Wide Web. We provide such links for your convenience only, and we are not responsible for the content in any site linked to from this website. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied as to the accuracy, legality, reliability or validity of any content on any other such site, and that such sites will be free of viruses or other harmful elements.
                                
                                    Browser push notifications
                                    
                                    Certain web browsers offer you the option to receive push notifications with news and other updates that may be of interest to you. When you visit our website using a supported browser you may see a prompt offering you the opportunity to opt in to receive push notifications from us. If you choose to do so we may from time to time send you notifications with important news, for example letting you know when we make new signings.
                                    
                                    Our push notification service is intended to supplement and not to replace other news sources, and we do not guarantee that it will be continuously available or notify you of all important Man City-related news. Your decision to opt-in will only apply to the particular web browser that you are using at the time, and if you wish to receive notifications through other browsers (for example browsers on your other devices) you will need to opt-in separately.
                                    
                                    Due to the nature of browser notifications, you may receive them when you are browsing other websites or even (in some cases) where you are not using the browser at all. The fact that our notification is displayed when you are browsing a third party website does not mean that we have any connection with that website or the company or entity that it represents. Whether or not you are browsing our website when the notification is received, all notifications are considered to form part of our site and are governed by these terms of use.
                                    
                                    If you wish to stop receiving push notifications at any time you can do this through your web browser settings. The process for doing this differs depending on which browser you are using and what type of device you are using it on. Please refer to the support documentation for your browser if you are unsure of how to change your notification settings.

A waiver of any provision hereunder shall not operate as a waiver of any other provision, or a continuing waiver of the same provision in the future. If any court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these terms to be void or unenforceable for any reason then such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the court’s finding without affecting the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These terms represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein and supersede any and all prior statements, understandings or agreements whether oral or written and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by you and Man City.
